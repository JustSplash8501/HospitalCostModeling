# Hospital Cost Modeling

This project is the first of several personal data science initiatives I’m adding to my portfolio outside of academic work. It focuses on understanding and predicting hospital costs using real-world healthcare data.

## Project Overview

The analysis is structured in **two main phases**:

### 1. Data Exploration
- Break down the dataset to understand **univariate relationships** (individual features).  
- Investigate **multivariate relationships** to uncover correlations and patterns between variables.  
- Identify key trends and insights to inform model development.

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- Build **two distinct models** aimed at predicting hospital costs as accurately as possible.  
    - multiple linear regression
    - randomForest
- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics to determine the best candidate for deployment.  
- Highlight insights and potential use cases for healthcare cost prediction.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- Quarto Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization  
- GitHub for version control and project documentation

## Key Takeaways
- Explored the dataset to gain actionable insights into hospital cost drivers.  
- Developed and evaluated predictive models for real-world healthcare applications.  
- Built a foundation for deploying data-driven solutions in medical cost management.
